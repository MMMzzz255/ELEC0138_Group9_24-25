## DDoS Attack Simulation  
A toolkit demonstrating SYN/UDP flood and HTTP slowloris attacks using `hping3` and `slowhttptest`.  

### Components:  
**Tool Setup**:  
- `hping3`: Generates high-volume SYN/UDP flood attacks.  
- `slowhttptest`: Executes slow HTTP requests to exhaust server resources.  
- Target server: Simple Python HTTP server for attack validation. 

**Attack Execution**:  
1. **SYN Flood**:  
   ```bash  
   sudo hping3 -S -p 8000 --flood <TARGET_IP>  # Replace <TARGET_IP>
2. **UDP Flood**:
   ```bash  
   sudo hping3 --udp --flood -p 8000 <TARGET_IP>
3. **HTTP Slowloris**:
    ```bash  
   slowhttptest -c 5000 -H -i 5 -r 500 -t GET -u http://<TARGET_IP>:8000 -x 24 -p 10
 ### Validation:
- Network Traffic: Use Wireshark with filter port 8000 to observe attack patterns.
- Server Load: Run top on the target to monitor CPU/memory spikes.
- Logs: Check Python server logs for connection errors or timeouts.
 ### Usage:
 - Install tools (Kali Linux).
- Start target server (Ubuntu VM)
- Execute attack commands (replace <TARGET_IP> with the server's IP).



## Phishing Attack Simulation
A Flask-based mock phishing page to demonstrate credential harvesting.

### Components:  
**Frontend**:
- Fake login page mimicking a government transport portal (login.html).[1]
- Redirects to a legitimate site post-credential capture to evade detection.
**Attack Logic**:  
- Collects 8-digit employee IDs and access codes via POST requests.
- Validates input format (strict 8-digit ID check) to mimic real phishing.
- Stores stolen credentials in captured_creds.txt.
 ### Usage:
- Install dependencies
- Launch the phishing server phishing_attack.py
- Access http://localhost:8888/login to trigger the phishing page.

```

Running the Project
- DDoS Defense:
  - Navigate to the ddos_defense/app directory.
  - Run the Flask app using `python ddos_defense_app`.
  - Upload a csv file for DDoS detection from /testing or other test file.
  - The app will process the file and display the results.
  - defense_log.txt will log the auto-defense activities.
- Phishing Defense:
  - Navigate to the phishing_defense/app directory.
  - Run the Flask app using `python phishing_defense_app`.
  - Upload the web info from /testing or other testcase.
  - The app will process the file and display the results.

Testing
- DDoS Defense Testing:
  - Use testing_ddos.py or testing_safe_ddos.py to create the test cases for DDoS detection. 
  - The test cases are generated based on the dataset in the data folder.
  - testing_ddos.py: Randomly generated 10% test cases are used to test the model.
  - testing_safe_ddos.py: Randomly generated 10% non-attack test cases are used to test the model.
- Phishing Defense Testing:
  - Testcase is given in the testing folder (exmaple.md)

Result
  - Result of the model are in the result folder it can be used to compare the performance of the SVM and Random Forest model.
  - The result includes the confusion matrix and the evaluation metrics of the model.

Switching Model
  - The model can be switched by changing the model name in the ddos_defense_app.py and phishing_defense_app.py file.
  - The trained model is given in the model folder in the ddos_defense and phishing_defense folder.
  - The model can be changed to any other model by changing the model name in the ddos_defense_app.py and phishing_defense_app.py file.

Retrain Model 
  - If you wish to retrain the model, you can use the training_ddos.py file by downloading the 
  dataset (CIC-DDoS2019) and place the dataset in data.py.
  Files including the preprocess python file and the training python file are included in the project folder.
